# PR Cleanup Proposal

## Completed Actions ✅
- **PR #239** - Merged successfully
- **PR #254** - Merged successfully  
- **PR #322** - Merged successfully

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unrelated Git Histories
43 PRs cannot be merged due to "unrelated histories" error. These branches were likely:
- Created from non-main bases
- Generated by automated tools without proper branching
- Imported from external sources

### 2. Bot-Generated PRs with Conflicts
Multiple automated PRs from:
- `coderabbitai/*` - 6 PRs
- `cubic-fix-*` - 10+ PRs  
- `copilot/*` - 8+ PRs
- `multi-launch-*` - 2 PRs

These target files that don't exist in main or have significant conflicts.

### 3. Cascading Dependencies
Many PRs state "merges into #XXX" where the base PR also has conflicts, creating chains of unmergeable PRs.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Close stale bot PRs** (older than 7 days with conflicts)
2. **Close duplicate PRs** (multiple PRs fixing same issue)
3. **Close PRs targeting non-existent files**

### For PRs with Valid Changes
1. Extract the actual code changes
2. Recreate on fresh branch from current main
3. Submit as new PR with proper history

### Process Improvements
1. Configure branch protection to prevent unrelated histories
2. Set up bot PR auto-close after 48h if unmergeable
3. Require all PRs to have CI passing before merge
4. Add pre-commit hooks to validate branch ancestry

## PRs Recommended for Closure

### Category A: Bot PRs with Unrelated Histories (Age > 7 days)
- #181, #286, #323-326, #331-334, #339, #343, #345-346, #364, #366, #369-370, #378-379, #381-389, #394-395, #398, #424

### Category B: Documentation-only PRs with Conflicts
- Multiple test documentation PRs that conflict with merged changes

## Manual Review Needed
Some PRs may contain valuable changes that should be preserved:
- Review each PR's diff
- Extract meaningful code changes
- Apply to fresh branches
