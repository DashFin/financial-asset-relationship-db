    Generate a human-readable Markdown report describing the asset relationship
    schema, calculated network metrics, top relationships, business/regulatory/
    valuation rules, and optimization recommendations.

    The report is assembled from metrics computed by the provided
    AssetRelationshipGraph and includes:
    - schema overview (entity and relationship types),
    - relationship distribution and asset class breakdown,
    - network statistics (total assets/relationships, average strength,
      density, regulatory events),
    - ordered top relationships with strengths,
    - predefined business, regulatory, and valuation rules,
    - a data quality score and a textual recommendation
      based on relationship density,
    - implementation notes.

    Parameters:
        graph (AssetRelationshipGraph): Graph instance used to calculate metrics required for the report.

    Returns:
        str: Complete Markdown-formatted report summarizing schema, metrics, rules, and recommendations.

## Schema Overview

### Entity Types
1. **Equity** - Stock instruments with P/E ratio, dividend yield, EPS
2. **Bond** - Fixed income with yield, coupon, maturity, credit rating
3. **Commodity** - Physical assets with contracts and delivery dates
4. **Currency** - FX pairs or single-currency proxies with exchange rates and policy links
5. **Regulatory Events** - Corporate actions and SEC filings

### Relationship Types
