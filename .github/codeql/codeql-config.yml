name: "Custom CodeQL Config"

# Exclude test files from certain queries that produce false positives
# NOTE: Do not ignore test files globally (via `paths-ignore`), as that would
# suppress all CodeQL findings in tests. Instead, use query-level filters below
# to exclude only the specific false positives we want to silence.

# Query filters to exclude specific rules that are not applicable for this project
query-filters:
  # Exclude "assert used" warnings in test files - pytest uses assert statements
  # and rewrites them at import time for better error messages.
  # This is the standard and recommended pattern for pytest.
  - exclude:
      id: py/assert-removed-in-optimized-code
      path:
        - "**/tests/**"
        - "**/test_*.py"
        - "**/*_test.py"
