# Debricked SCA Vulnerability Scanning Workflow
#
# This workflow performs Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify
# dependency vulnerabilities during development and before changes are merged.
#
# Security Features:
# - Uses GitHub Actions secrets for authentication (DEBRICKED_TOKEN)
# - Minimal required permissions (least privilege principle)
# - Pinned action versions for supply-chain security
# - No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data logging
#
# Triggers:
# - Pull requests to main branch (gated verification)
# - Pushes to main branch (continuous monitoring)
# - Manual dispatch (adhoc verification)
