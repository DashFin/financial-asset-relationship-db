    Parse a requirements-style file and produce a list of package names with their combined version specifiers.
    
    The parser:
    - ignores empty lines and full-line comments;
    - strips inline comments after `#`;
    - splits comma-separated spec segments and extracts the package name from the first segment;
    - collects all version specifiers (operators such as `>=`, `==`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `~=`) across segments and joins them with commas;
    - treats an entry with no specifiers as having an empty version specifier.
